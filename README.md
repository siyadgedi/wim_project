# Final Project

## Submission Information

This project is an implementation of WIM, where objects in the miniature world are manipulated and the changes are simultaneously observed in the larger world. Objects are manipulated through a marker and spindle user interface, by which objects can be scaled, rotated, and moved around.

We have also added another dimension of interactivity, where the world itself can be rotated by a separate plane interface that affects the world in miniature and by extension the larger world, and the objects behave accordingly to their physics.
